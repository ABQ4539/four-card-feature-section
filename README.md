## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned
- I learnt ho to add a `box-shadow` property by specifying 4 values; the vertical offset first then the horizontal offset followed by the blur effect and then the color of the shadow. An example is shown below:

- I also learnt how to center an element by setting the `margin-inline` property to `auto`.

```css
.card {
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px black;
    margin-inline: auto;
}
```

### Useful resources
